    <P>"Heal the past, live the present, and dream the future." I believe that my past makes me who I am today and the future depends on my present life. My life reflects the piano. What I get out of it depends on how I play it. In this journey of my life, I have to overcome many obstacles to be where I am today. Going back on my life, it brings forth a feeling of nostalgia. It seems as if were only yesterday, I was a child and now I am beginning a new milestone in my life. I now look back at those obstacles and smile at all those times that seem so unimportant. Today those memories bring a sign of joy to my life, and a desire to go back.
        As I aboard a train to take me back in time, all these memories come rushing back to me. I am now looking at my past. I inhale the air of my seventh grade year. It is the air where I learned to overcome my obstacles. Looking back at my seventh grade picture, I see a quiet, shy girl with a lack of confidence and that spend most of her days in solitude, due to her parents inability to let go of her. My shyness and lack of participation in school activities was also in many ways due to my parent's strict rules. I became an outcast of many activities because I was too shy to make friends and too shy to start a conversation. The reason I never rebelled was because of the gratitude, which I had for my dad for putting his happiness aside and thinking of his daughter's well being. Today, I feel that I have come a long way from the quiet reserved girl in junior high. I believe that the turning point in my life was during my eight-grade year, for it was when I began to become independent. I decided that it was time for me to leave my shyness behind and start all over, for I had many more years to come, where my shyness would hinder
        opportunities that would only come once. My motivation and desire for success made me little by little stand on my own, and pursued what I dream. I knew that if I wanted to become a realty.</P>

        <h1>One thing to keep in "mind"</h1>
        <p>To cut the long story short, my society always did told me: "Be yourself." But what did that mean? I wanted to be authentic, even if i did know what it is. That the paradox of the mordern vervion of be your self, Rather than searching within. My society we're trying to convert me into their belives, I knew they have turn their inner exploration into a guessing game. i always knew being your self was not about standing out or being different from others.
            I understand being authentic is following your path, not comparing to others. If i had try to be "different," i could have disconnect from what i was. As a wise man once said "Authenticity is about staying true to what you believe not about your image, to be brave to express your genuine feelings and oponoins".
            Life is beautiful but not always easy. It has problems too, and the challenge lies in facing them with courage, letting the beauty of life act like a painkiller, making the pain bearable during trying times by providing hope.

            Happiness and sorrow, victory and defeat, day and night are just two sides of the coin. Similarly, life is full of moments of joy, pleasure, success, and comfort punctuated by misery, defeat, failures, and problems. There is no human being on Earth that is strong, powerful, wise, or rich who has not experienced struggle, suffering, or failure.
            
            No doubt, life is beautiful, and every moment is a celebration of being alive, but one should always be ready to face adversity and challenges. A person who has not encountered difficulties in life can never achieve success. Difficulties test the courage, patience, perseverance, and true character of a human being. Adversity and hardships make a person strong and ready to face the challenges of life with equanimity. There is no doubt that there can be no gain without pain. It is only when one toils and sweats it out that success is nourished and sustained.
            
            Thus, life should not be just a bed of roses; thorns are also a part of it and should be accepted by us just as we accept the beautiful side of life. The thorns remind one of how success and happiness can be evasive and instead of feeling disappointed and disheartened rather remember that the pain of thorns is short-lived, and the beauty of life would soon overcome the prick of thorns. Those who are under the impression that life is a bed of roses are disillusioned soon and become victims of depression and frustration. One who faces difficulties with courage and accepts success without letting it go to their head is the one who experience real happiness, contentment, and peace in life.
            
            Those who think that good times last forever easily succumb to pressure during difficulties. They do not put in required hard work and efforts because they break down easily. You can take the example of a student who burns the midnight oil, makes sacrifices, and resists temptations so that he can perform well. Similarly, a successful executive has to face the ups and downs of life, not forgetting that life is a mix of success and failure, joy, and sorrow. If he loses hope during difficult times, he would not achieve success and would be replaced by others. Even the strongest kings and emperors have had their cup of woes.
            
            Life has not been a bed of roses for them. The adage "uneasy lays the head that wears the crown" has been rightly used for people, who are successful and are enjoying power and authority.
            
            To sum up, life is beauteous just as roses, but it has challenges which are like thorns and have to be faced and overcome by all. Those who accept these challenges and succeed are the ones who know how to live life in its true sense. Thus, enjoy life but also be prepared to bear the pricks of pain.</p>
